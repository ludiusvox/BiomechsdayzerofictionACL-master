                <p class="P">Nuri Tal, an engineering student is attending a lecture in chemical engineering at Ben Gurion University.  After the lecture, he gets called into the office for having difficulty on his qualifying exam. Nuri vows to retake the exam the next semester.

                    On the way home, Nuri while stuck in traffic experiences a drone strike to a vehicle in front of him.  Nuri checks the wreckage before the police get there, and discovers a fire safe in the wreckage.  Recgnizing it as government property, Nuri grabs the fire safe before it can be seized by anyone else.
                    
                    Taking it back to his apartment, he opens up the fire safe and discovers an external solid state drive.  Hooking it up to his computer, it appears to be plans of a large humanoid robot .DWG file, along with analysis papers, material papers, electrical diagrams. It is produced by Raguel defense systems. In the drive there is a file with an address to return the box to, in case it is discovered.
                    
                    He relocks the safe and places it under his bed and goes to sleep. (test) </p>
                    
              </div>
              <div class="col-6">
                <p>
                    The next day, Nuri wakes up late and checks his cellphone for messages.  He has 3 messages on his cellphone of classmates asking why he wasn't in class.  He explains to his friend about the drone strike and this mysterious package he found.  They meet up at a coffee shop near the school and check out the location of the owning company of the package.  The address is in Haifa.
        
                Nuri and Dion set out for a several hour drive to Haifa.  On the freeway they notice a black van following them, they try to drive faster and escape their persuer, and after a car race, they pull off their exit and the car rams them, they eventually make it racing to the company headquarters until they get to armored security.  The security guards pull out their guns and shoot at the attacker who flees.  After showing the case, the security lets them in, and they are brought into an intervew room and give their story.
        
                After the documents are recovered, Elanna explains what they were for and explains that now that they have seen the documents they are unable to leave because they are privy to military secrets.
        
                Elanna shows them into the hangar to see the BioMech.  Elanna explains the design and what it is built to do, and it's defense capabilities, she also explains that it is not fully operational and that the case Nuri was carrying carries the final bit of manufacturing instructions and data needed to complete the Biomech.
        
                Elanna also is aware that the Iranian military must have some intelligence about the Biomech that's why Nuri and Dion were persued and explains the drone strike.
        
                Elanna has armed soldiers equip GPS ankle bracelets on Nuri and Dion and changes their SIM cards in their cellphones and warns them not to leak any information because their phones are bugged now.  She also gives them vouchers for a hotel room in Haifa and explains that the company will be confiscating their vehicle.
        
                Nuri and Dion are escorted to the entrance and picked up by an SUV which takes them to a hotel in Haifa and drops them off.

                <p>
                    In the morning, the phone rings.  Elanna calls the hotel room, not too early, and tells Dion and Nuri to come to HQ.  After a short trip to HQ, Elanna explains that because they are both privy to the plans of the EX-001 that they are welcome to stay and work on the project  While they are talking, the sounds of a huge explosion are outside, all of a sudden the sounds of gunfire fill the air and screams from people shot.
    
                To hide from the gunman, Elanna grabs the fire safe, and Dion, and Nuri climb into the cockpit (4 seater). Elanna activates the EX-001, but has difficulty with the controls, she explains that the neurohelmet is not calibrated to any pilot yet so there is difficulties in controlling the Biomech.
    
                Elanna awakens the biomech, and turns on the artificial intelligence systems for target tracking.  As the terrorists bust in, the biomech begins opening up small arms fire on them.
    
                A terrorist launches a tow missile at the Biomech and the Trophy vehicle protection system goes off.
    
                The terrorists take cover and the battle is at a stalemate.  Without air support in a closed area, the biomech is trapped even though it is not taking damage from footsoldiers.
    
                So Elanna escapes with the biomech and plans to head to an alternate facility.  On the way Elanna explains what is in the security case, and why the terrorists want it so badly.
    
                The party quickly escapes out of town riding in EX-001, which is slow it walks about 5 miles per hour. Elanna makes a phonecall and arranges a flatbed trailer with hay on it, and they load up the dinosaur and Elanna explains that they are going to go to a secret area, since the HQ was terrorized by militants.

                            Niru Sabet (Sattalite officer), is watching the screen, he is tracking the group on a tracker.  A meeting with fellow officers determined that when the strike team got to the bomb site there was nothing recovered, but the drone tracked an image of a young man recovering a fire safe, and they tracked him via sattalite to BGU, and then to Haifa.  Once they verified he was at Raziel industries HQ, they ordered a covert strike team, but nothing was recovered.
            
                        They were tracking the animal after the escape, but nightfall came and they lost tracking from sattalite and didn't have air surveillance.  All they have is a photo of the man with the fire safe.
            
                        The phone rings, Kouosh Paria is on the phone, a conversation ensues.  Kuoush directs them to put spies outside of every Raziel systems corporation plant, office, until they get a positive lead.
            
                        They seem to be willing to throw away manpower in order to reach their goal.

                                The team arrives at the Raziel Systems Corporation building in a truck.  They unload and head in.  It appears to be a genomics lab.
                                Elanna explains that this is the birthplace of the EX-001. She explains that this is the final workplace of Dr. Braxton Langridge, an American Scientist who developed the protoype of the current model by advanced molecular dynamic simulations at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, who developed the genome through simulation and modeling, using bioinformatics technology.  But it was only possible through large collaborations of scientists, and has been a secret project for 30 years.
                
                                Nuri discusses how they are going to discover who to retaliate against for the attacks.  They contact the Vio corporation  who says they will send an agent to assist them.  The Vio corporation Agent Arrives.
                
                                She explains the situation, that they are being tracked by Satallite. Iran has contracted out Satallite launches with China so they could provide real-time military surveillance of Israel.
                
                                She says that it is almost impossible to decrypt their military satallite because they are using quantum entanglement.
                
                                She begins by capturing the sound files on all short-wave radio frequencies and converting them to MP3 and uploading them to a quantum supercomputer for batch decryption.  She then processes the files using text to speech algorithms once they have been decrypted and looks for.
                
                                Eventually she comes up with a master file and does a search algorithm, and she finds their network.  She discovers that their network is watching the facilities.

                                Nuri, Dion, Elanna, and Radeyah plan to set a trap for their Iranian counterparts.  Nuri still has his cellphone and his GPS chip and connects his app to Elanna.
                
                                Nuri leaves the facility on foot, and begins walking to a restaurant.  He notices people following him.  He goes into the restaurant and starts eating and gets held up by a concealed weapon.  Leaving his meal unfinished, he walks outside where he is put into a van and a cloth is put over his head.
                
                                He is interrogated, and beaten...
                
                                Meanwhile, Elanna sees his signal dissapear as they turned off Nuri's phone.  The group including Radeyah packs into EX-001, and they input his last known coordinates...
                
                                Nuri is still being beaten, and tells them he just chanced upon it by accident, but being a former IDF soldier he is bound to return it to the company.  The interrogator pulls out a gun, and gets ready to execute him.
                
                                And EX-001 slams his tail through the wall slamming the table.  There is automatic gunfire going off on EX-001 by some of the interrogators subordinates. EX-001's guns autotarget down the terrorists that are armed and the crew jumps out of the cabin space, and pull their guns out on the interrogator.
                
                                After an interrogation is complete, Elanna zip ties him and calls the police and tells them that they just broke up a hostage situation, and gives her address.
                
                                The group heads back to the Biolab in the Ex-001 cabin.
                
                                There is a conversation about the location of the Iranian alliance Satallite proxy forces location in lebenon and what they can do to knock out their sattalite command center.

He gets on the phone and Calls Kouosh.  A conversation occurs on what to do, Kuoush explains that they are well defended in hezbollah territory and do not fear an attack.  And continue to persue the party on Sattalite but don't send anymore strike teams in as they have been able to assess the strength of the unit it is capable of taking out their foot soldiers.
                
                                Kouosh is curious to see how their vehicle will fair against an armored division.

                                Meanwhile Nuri and company are strategizing how to attack the satallite communications team, this is EX-001 first military engagement.  Elanna explains that she is going to have Nuri sync the neurohelmet so he can pilot the EX-001, Elanna is not coming with them. They plan on Air Dropping onto Lebanon, since they have pinpointed the location of the base.
                
                                They equip the target painter for the satallite ground-to-space-to ground based laser, and also resupply the chemical stimulants for the EX-001 for fast reaction time.  Then they load up on an airplane with anti-air defenses and prepare to drop.

                                At the last minute before boarding, Elanna announces over the radio that the IDF has agreed to conduct airstrikes in Lebenon, foregoing the need of ground forces right now.  So the original mission is canceled.  They all appear relieved.

Suddenly he hears the shrieking of a missile and an explosion from his office and he falls on the ground, dead.

                While the animal drinks, a discussion starts of where they are headed, Elanna radios in and asks for a truck, and the dispatcher explains they are to head to the road.
                
                Dawn breaks, and they head to the highway, and a wide-bed semi-truck comes to pick them up.  The ramp propels back and they load up the dinosaur and set the monster to sleep.
                
                A discussion follows of the war ability.  Nuri is very surprised at the networking IoT of the weapons with the satallite.
